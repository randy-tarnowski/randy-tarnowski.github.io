### 2019-12-24: Christmas Songs

This week's #TidyTuesday challenge is examining Christmas songs that have shown up historically on the Billboard Top 100 from the 1950s to the 2010s. 

See the full details [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-24)

> _This week's data is about Christmas songs on the hot-100 list! Clean data comes from Kaggle and originally from data.world. The lyrics come courtest of Josiah Parry's genius R package. It has several useful functions, mainly built around grabbing lyrics for specific artists, songs, or albums._

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
