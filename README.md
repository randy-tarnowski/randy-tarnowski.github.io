# Website Notes

## Templates
### Overall Page
The main website is a Hugo theme, based on the [Minimal](https://themes.gohugo.io/minimal/) theme. The goal here was to create a site that was dynamic, minimal, and readable, showcasing the content in a way that aligns with my approach to data viz. 
### Portfolio Page
Used a HTML5 Bootstrap ["Magazine"](https://freehtml5.co/magazine-free-html5-bootstrap-template/) theme for the portfolio section. I really liked the magazine/book-style showcase, though I might want to shrink to get more information on the screen.
