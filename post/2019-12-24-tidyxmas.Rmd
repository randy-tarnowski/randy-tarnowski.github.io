#### 2019-12-24: Christmas Songs
This week’s #TidyTuesday challenge examines Christmas songs appearing on the Billboard Top 100 from the 1950s to the 2010s.

See the full details [here]("https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-24")

>This week's data is about Christmas songs on the hot-100 list! Clean data comes from Kaggle and originally from data.world. The lyrics come courtest of Josiah Parry's genius R package. It has several useful functions, mainly built around grabbing lyrics for specific artists, songs, or albums. Data source [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-12-24)



<br>

#### Step 1: Data Prep
I decided to focus on word frequencies within all songs that ever occurred on the Billboard Top 100. Since I still wanted to maintain a record of both the number of occurrences, as well as the overall sentiment, I aggregated the original dataset and summarized the number of occurences over the past 60+ years.

For whatever reason, the original dataset did not contain the lyrics for each song. I figured this was a great time to take advantage of the Genius package. If you’re interested, check out the arduous process of collecting lyrics to such hits as “What Can You Get a Wookie For Christmas (When He Already Owns a Comb?)” in my source code  [here](https://github.com/randy-tarnowski/tidytuesday/blob/master/2019-12-24_ChristmasSongs/FINAL_12.24.19.R)

#### Step 2: Tokenize Lyrics, Prep for Sentiment Analysis
DETAILS ON CHOOSING BING VS.
```{r step2}
# set lexicon
bing <- get_sentiments("bing")
lyrics<-agg%>%
  select(-1:-4)%>%
  select(-sentiment)
lyrics$lyrics<-as.character(lyrics$lyrics)
bing$sentiment<-as.character(bing$sentiment)
```



<br>

#### Step 3: Conduct Sentiment Analysis
```{r step3}
# counting negative / positive words
sentiment <-lyrics%>%
  unnest_tokens(word, lyrics) %>% 
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  # join afinn score
  inner_join(bing) %>%
  count(word, sentiment, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(word!="bum")

```

```{r step3b, echo=FALSE}
# counting negative / positive words
sentiment <-sentiment%>%
  mutate(word=ifelse(word=="bitch", "b****h", word),
         word=ifelse(word=="shit", "s**t", word))
sentiment$word<-stringr::str_to_sentence(sentiment$word)
```

<br>

#### Step 4: Visualization
```{r step4}
# FINAL PLOT
sentiment %>%
  group_by(sentiment) %>%
  top_n(15) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(word = reorder(word, n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(word, n, fill = sentiment)) +
  geom_col(alpha = 0.8, show.legend = FALSE,  colour="white", stat="identity") +
  facet_wrap(~sentiment, scales = "free_y") +
  labs(y = "Source: Billboard Top 100 (1958-2017, A Dash of Data) \n Randy Tarnowski | @randytarnowski",
       x = NULL,
       title="Naughty & Nice: Most Commonly Occurring Positive/Negative Words in Top 100 Christmas Songs",
       subtitle = "From the Bing/Minqing lexicon") +
  coord_flip() +
  theme_ipsum_rc() + 
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("red", "seagreen")) + 
  theme(axis.text.y=element_text(size=rel(1.25))) +
  theme(plot.subtitle = element_text(face = "italic"))
```



<br>

#### Step 5: Further Analysis

Now that all the lyrics are collected, there are many areas for further analysis. This includes:

* **Decade-based Research:** Is there a difference in the overall mood of Christmas songs by decade? I’ve always loved the melancholic underpinning of a lot of Christmas songs (e.g., Charlie Brown X-Mas songs, Last Christmas, etc.).
* **Alternative Sentiments:**


```{r cars}
# basic scatterplot
agg<-agg%>%
  mutate(colors=ifelse(sentiment<0, "Negative", "Positive"))

ggplotly(ggplot(agg, aes(x=n, y=sentiment, label=agg$songid, group=colors)) + 
  geom_jitter(width = 10, aes(color=as.factor(colors))) +
  theme_ipsum() + 
    labs(y = "Sentiment (+ is positive, - is negative)",
       x = "Number of Occurences on Top 100",
       title="Sentiment by Number of Occurences on Billboard"))
```
